# CS301 Project 2 - Student Depression Prediction

**Course:** CS301-H02 Spring 2025  
**Project:** Machine Learning Modeling and Analysis  
**Dataset Source:** [Student Depression Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/student-depression-dataset?resource=download)

## Project Overview

This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to predict student depression based on various academic, social, and personal indicators. The dataset contains over 20 features, including both **numerical** and **categorical** variables, related to academic performance, support systems, family history, and emotional well-being.

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Detailed statistical analysis and visualization of key features.
- Identification and handling of missing or inconsistent data.
- Feature selection using correlation metrics and visual tools.
- Preprocessing steps such as normalization and encoding.

### Task 2: Train Models
- Defined the problem as a **classification task** (depression: yes/no).
- Trained two models:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Explained and implemented optimization algorithms including Gradient Descent and Gini Impurity (for tree-based models).

### Task 3: Test and Evaluate
- Used test data to evaluate both models.
- Applied multiple evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - Confusion Matrix
- Included metric formulas and explanations.

### Task 4: Model Comparison
- Compared models on predictive performance and robustness to noise.
- Discussed the impact of categorical features and model assumptions.
- Provided analysis on overfitting, feature importance, and interpretability.
